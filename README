This Python app creates a frontend skeleton based on Flask, Flask-Assets and the govuk_frontend_toolkit (and GOV.UK template). This renders pages with the GOV.UK style. Webpages can be coded using styles from GOV.UK Elements.

govuk_frontend_toolkit is pulled in as a git submodule.
To get the contents of the submodule run the following git commands.
git submodule init
git submodule update
